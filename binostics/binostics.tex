\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) is a useful plot to make to examine the
distribution of two variables, for linear or nonlinear association,
clustering, outliers, discrete, or barriers. However, if there are many
variables there will be too many to practically display. For many
variables it can be useful to find the most interesting pairs of
variables using scagnostics (scatterplot diagnostics)
\citep[\citet{WW08}]{scag}. A smaller subset of interesting pairs of
variables can then be shown in a SPLOM.

There are eight measures calculated in scagnostics: outlying, skewed,
sparse, clumpy, striated, convex, skinny, stringy, and monotonic. These,
themselves can be examined using a SPLOM. This is especially helpful if
some interactivity, so that the scagnostic values can be explored using
mouseover or tooltip, to reveal the pair of variables that generates any
value.

\hypertarget{scagnostics-measures}{%
\subsection{Scagnostics measures}\label{scagnostics-measures}}

Following \citet{scag} the scagnostics measures are evaluated on the
data after hexagon binning, and based on the Delaunay triangulation for
comutational efficiency. In addition, outlying points are removed before
computing the measures (with exception of the Outlying measure), to make
the measures more robust.

\hypertarget{underlying-definitions}{%
\subsubsection{Underlying definitions}\label{underlying-definitions}}

All measures are based on graphs, i.e.~a set of vertices and edges, that
can all be extracted from the Delaunay triangulation, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the convex hull, i.e.~the outer edges of the Delaunay triangulation
\item
  the alpha hull \citep{1056714}
\item
  the minimum spanning tree (MST) \citep{kruskal1956}
\end{itemize}

In the following, the length of the MST is defined as the sum of lengths
of all edges, and \(q_x\) is defined as the \(x\)th percentile of the
MST edge lengths.

When computing the alpha hull, \(\alpha\) is set to \(q_{90}\)
\citep{scag}. The definition of outlying points is also based on edge
length, with points being tagged as outlying if all adjacent edges in
the MST have a lenght larger than \begin{equation}
w = q_{75} + 1.5 ( q_{75} - q_{25}).
\label{eq:w}
\end{equation} Several of the measures are corrected for dependence on
sample size using the weight \begin{equation}
\omega = 0.7 + \frac{0.3}{1+t^2},
\end{equation} where \(t = n / 500\) and \(n\) the sample size. This
correction weight was determined by comparing the scagnostics measures
over a large number of datasets \citep{scag}.

\hypertarget{measure-definitions}{%
\subsubsection{Measure definitions}\label{measure-definitions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Outlying}: compares the edge lengths of the MST of outlying
  points with the length of the original MST T \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{outlying}} = \frac{length(T_{\mathrm{outliers}})}{length(T)}
  \end{equation}
\item
  \textbf{Skewed}: is measuring skewness in the distribution of MST edge
  lengths (and thus large values might not correspond to skewed
  distributions of points) as \begin{equation}
  c'_{\mathrm{skewed}} = \frac{q_{90}-q_{50}}{q_{90}-q_{10}},
  \end{equation} and is corrected to adjust for dependence on the sample
  size as \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{skewed}} = 1 - \omega (1 - c'_{\mathrm{skewed}}).
  \end{equation}
\item
  \textbf{Sparse}: detects if points are only found in small number of
  locations in the plane, as is the case for categorical variables,
  \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{sparse}} = \omega q_{90}.
  \end{equation}
\item
  \textbf{Clumpy}: to detect clustering we split the MST in two parts by
  removing a single edge \(j\), and compare the largest edge lenght
  within the smaller of the two subsets to the length of the removed
  edge \(j\). The clumpy measure is defined by maximising over all edges
  in the MST as \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{clumpy}} = \max_j [1 - \max_k[\mathrm{length}(e_k)] / \mathrm{length}(e_j) ],
  \end{equation} with \(k\) running over all edges in the smaller
  subgraph found after removing edge \(j\) from the MST.
\item
  \textbf{Striated}: aims to detect patterns like smooth algebraic
  functions or parallel lines, by evaluating the angles between adjacent
  edges, \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{striated}} = \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{v\in V^{(2)}} I(\cos\theta_{e(v,a)e(v,b)} < -0.75),
  \end{equation} where \(V\) is the set of vertices, \(|V|\) the total
  number of vertices in the triangulation, \(V^{(2)}\) the subset of
  vertices with two edges (i.e.~vertices of degree two), and \(I\) the
  indicator function.
\item
  \textbf{Convex}: convexity is computed as the ratio of the area of the
  alpha hull \(A\) and the convex hull \(H\), adjusting for sample size
  dependence, \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{convex}} = \omega \frac{area(A)}{area(H)}.
  \end{equation}
\item
  \textbf{Skinny}: The ratio of the perimeter to the area of the alpha
  hull \(A\), with normalization such that zero corresponds to a full
  circle and values close to 1 indicate a skinny polygon,
  \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{skinny}} = 1 -  \frac{\sqrt{4\pi area(A)}}{perimeter(A)}.
  \end{equation}
\item
  \textbf{Stringy}: a stringy distribution should have no branches in
  the MST. This is evaluated by counting the number of vertices of
  degree two and comparing them to the total number of vertices
  (dropping those of degree one), \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{stringy}} = \frac{|V^{(2)}|}{|V| - |V^{(1)}|}.
  \end{equation}
\item
  \textbf{Monotonic}: monotonicity is evaluated via the squared Spearman
  correlation coefficient, i.e.~the Pearson correlation between the
  ranks of \(x\) and \(y\), \begin{equation}
  c_{\mathrm{monotonic}} = r_{\mathrm{Spearman}}^2.
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

XXX maybe there is a problem with the implementation of outlying,
because this sometimes gives values larger than one? (e.g.~vs vs am on
mtcars, also gives NaN for several other measures: clumpy, striated,
stringy, monotonic)

\hypertarget{interface}{%
\subsection{Interface}\label{interface}}

The elementary function in the binostics package \texttt{scagnostics}
and can be called with a pair of vectors or a two-dimensional data
structure (a matrix or data frame).

The default S3 method is for a pair of vectors and will compute the
scagnostics measures for a single scatter plot. In this case additional
control and output. The additional arguments \texttt{bins} and
\texttt{outlierRmv} can be used for detailed checkes, but should not be
necessary for most applications. The output in this mode is a named list
\texttt{out}, with \texttt{out\$s} reporting the scagnostics measures
for the scatter plot, and \texttt{out\$bins} returns the binned data
used to compute them. Note that only non-empty bins are kept, and the
format is a \(3\times n\) matrix where the columns correspond to the bin
position in \(x, y\) and the bin count, and each row is a non-empty bin.
Internally the x and y axis is mapped to integer numbers, and the bin
size is reset if there are more than 250 non-empty bins, and this is
reflected in the matrix returned to the user.

In most applications we are interested in the scagnostics measures for
all combinations of variables in the input data. This is evaluated when
passing a matrix or data frame to the \texttt{scagnostics} function. In
this mode the function returns a data frame, where each row corresponds
to one combination of variables, and we have one column for each
scagnostics index. Two additional columns \texttt{var1} and
\texttt{var2} report the corresponding variable names.

Finally, we may only be interested in a single scagnostics index for a
pair of vectors. Since the measures all rely on the underlying binning
and triangulation we simply provide wrapper functions to access this
information conveniently. These functions are named according after the
corresponding scagnostics measure and report the index as an unnamed
scalar. This mode would be preferred e.g.~when using the measure as a
projection pursuit index.

\hypertarget{implementation-connecting-r-and-c}{%
\subsection{Implementation connecting R and
C++}\label{implementation-connecting-r-and-c}}

The interface is written in R and handels the reading the input, finds
all combinations of variables in the case of matrix input. For each pair
of variables it then pre-processes the data: entries with missing values
in either of the two variables are dropped, and each variable is
centered and scaled by its range. It is then using a direct call to C++
for the computation of the measures, as described below, and finally
collecting and formatting the output as described above.

The underlying C++ implementation allows for a fast evaluation, in
particular it handles the binning and triangulation. The triangulation
is used to determine the MST, convex hull and alpha hull, which are then
used to compute the measures. The calculation is done in the following
steps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Binning of the data: we use hexagonal binning, where the number of
  bins is a free parameter. Note that if this results in more than 250
  non-empty bins in the result, half the number of bins will be used
  instead.
\item
  Computing the Delaunay triangulation and the MST
\item
  Outlier detection: we use a cutoff on the edge length (see Eq.
  \ref{eq:w}), to identify outlying points. The triangulation and
  computation of the MST are repeated after removing the tagged
  outliers.
\item
  Compute scagnostics measures.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsection{Example}\label{example}}

To illustrate the use of scagnostics via the binostics package, we
evaluate them for the Parkinsons data \citep{parkinsons} available from
\citet{uci_parkinsons}. The dataset is composed of 22 biomedical voice
measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD), each
column is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of
195 voice recording from these individuals. The original aim of the data
was to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, and the data also
records to ``status'' (0 for healthy individuals and 1 for those with
PD). Here we instead look for patterns in combinations of the 22
variables, irrespective of the status.

Given the 22 input variables, there are 231 bivariate plots to look at,
and we can use scagnostics to select the most interesting ones. We start
by reading in the data, dropping the identifier and status columns, and
evaluating the scagnostics measures for all variable combinations. To
show the data structure we use the \texttt{glimpse} function to show the
first few entries. The data frame returned by the
\texttt{binostics::scagnostics} call has one column for each scagnostics
measure, and \texttt{var1} and \texttt{var2} reporting the corresponding
variable combination for each entry.

\begin{Schunk}

pk <- as.data.frame(read.csv("data/parkinsons.csv")[,-c(1,18)])

To get an overview of the results we can make a scatterplot matrix
showing pairs of scagnostics measures, where each point now corresponds
to one combination of input variables (i.e.~one bivariate scatterplot of
the original data). This is most useful in an interactive plot that
allows us to identify the variables associated with each point, and we
can combine the \texttt{GGally::ggpairs} with \texttt{plotly::ggplotly}
to generate this interactive display, as shown in the commented section
of the code.

We can generate a scatterplot matrix directly using the data frame
returned by \texttt{binostics}, where the first nine columns contain the
scagnostics measures.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# get SPLOM using GGally
GGally::ggpairs(s, columns=1:9)
\end{Sinput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{/Users/dicook/supervisor_post_docs/Ursula/paper-binostics/figs/pairs-1} \end{center}

\end{Schunk}

This shows a few outlying points, i.e.~parameter combinations that
should correspond to interesting scatterplots of the data. To find the
corresponding parameters we can use \texttt{plotly} in an interactive
display. To display the labels when hovering over points we can set the
text aestetics, note however that this will be interpreted as grouping
and will result in warnings when generating the graph.

XXX additionally would be useful to have linked highlighting when
hovering so we can compare across scagnostics measures

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
## read variable columns to generate point labels
## these are only used in the interactive display
s <-  dplyr::mutate(s, labs = paste0(var1,"-",var2))
## to generate a useful interactive plotly version we can
## pass in the labels as text text (note that this will cause warnings in ggpairs)
GGally::ggpairs(s, aes(text = labs), columns=1:9) %>%
  plotly::ggplotly()
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

Some interesting combinations that we have identified are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``MDVP.RAP'' vs ``Jitter.DDP'': this combination leads to values close
  to or exactly one for multiple measures, Striated, Skinny, Stringy and
  Monotonic, while Convex, Clumpy and Sparse are close to zero. However,
  the scatterplot is not very interesting, the two variables are
  perfectly correlated.
\item
  ``Shimmer.APQ5'' vs ``HNR'': this combination stand out because it has
  large Skewed measure (0.84) but lower Monotonic measure (0.53). The
  scatterplot display shows a branching of observations for larger
  values of Shimmer.APQ5.
\item
  ``MDVP.Fo.Hz.'' vs ``MDVP.Fhi.Hz.'': this combination has both low
  Convex (0.07) and Monotonic (0.25) measures, and the scatterplot shows
  strong linear correlation with few outlying points.
\item
  ``MDVP.Jitter.Abs.'' vs ``Jitter.DDP'': this combination stands out as
  having an unusual combination of measures, including values of Skewed
  (0.86), Sparse (0.05), Striated (0.18), Skinny (0.41) and Monotonic
  (0.76). The scatterplot display shows discreetness along
  MDVP.Jitter.Abs. and an unusual shape of the distribution.
\end{itemize}
